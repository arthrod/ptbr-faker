Your goal is to add the class DocumentSampler to our implementation at 'data/sampler_ptbr.py'. However, differently from the other classes, this one will be a separate file data/document_sampler.py, in the same folder of the script. Add checkboxes to each of the tasks below. 
Tasks:
1. Add the following parameters to our typer at sampler_ptbr.py:
CEI, if the user wants to generate CEIs, defaults to no,
CNPJ, if the user wants to generate CNPJs, defaults to no,
CPF, if the user wants to generate CPFs, defaults to yes,
RG, if the user wants to generate RGs, defaults to yes,
PIS, if the user wants to generate PIS, defaults to no.
2. Add the class DocumentSampler to the file data/document_sampler.py.
3. Based on the utils/cei.py file, add the function generate_cei to the class DocumentSampler.
4. Based on the utils/cnpj.py file, add the function generate_cnpj to the class DocumentSampler.
5. Based on the utils/cpf.py file, add the function generate_cpf to the class DocumentSampler.
6. Based on the utils/pis.py, add the function generate_pis to the class DocumentSampler.
7. Add a new column on the response table to show the generated documents, it should be called "Documents".
